# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Cross-package

- Switch to npm workspaces. New top-level `package.json` lists `server`, `converter`, and `react-app` as workspaces and exposes `npm run setup` (install + build) and `npm run build` (build react-app and copy into `server/build/`) at the repo root. Replaces the previous per-package install ritual and the `server/build:ui` script. Single root `package-lock.json` replaces the three per-package lockfiles. CI workflow updated to install once at the root and run lint/typecheck/test per workspace.
- Add `server/bin/init-instance.ts` for bootstrapping and upgrading multi-instance deploys: creates the directory tree, generates `.env` with a fresh random `SECRET`, creates a `code` symlink in the instance dir pointing at the running version's code root. Re-runs are idempotent — same code root acts as a doctor and reports missing `.env` keys (`--fix` appends defaults), different code root acts as an upgrade and backs up the DB to `db.sqlite3.pre-<new-version>` before flipping the symlink. Same script handles every lifecycle event for an instance.
- **Breaking (deployment):** drop the `PHOTO_ROOT_DIR` and `DB_OPTS` env vars. The photo repository now lives at the fixed path `<instance-dir>/photos/` and the SQLite DB at `<instance-dir>/db.sqlite3` — both relative to the server's / converter's working directory (the instance directory when launched via `start-prod.sh`). Existing deploys: rename `<instance>.sqlite3` → `db.sqlite3` in each instance dir; symlink `<instance>/photos` (or the whole instance dir) if the photos live elsewhere, e.g. `ln -s /mnt/data/dailybw /var/photo-diary/dailybw/photos`. Remove the two now-inert lines from each instance's `.env`.
- Add `server/bin/start-prod.sh` and `converter/bin/start-prod.sh` wrappers: each sources `.env` from the current working directory and derives the pm2 process name from `INSTANCE_NAME` (`<name>` and `<name>-converter`). Symlink-resilient — invoke via the instance dir's `code/server/bin/start-prod.sh` and they still locate their own code root correctly. The `prod` npm script in both packages now invokes the wrapper. Single-instance use stays the same — without an `INSTANCE_NAME`, the pm2 names fall back to `photo-diary-server` / `photo-diary-converter`.
- Document the multi-instance deploy pattern in the top-level README: versioned code under `/opt/photo-diary/<version>/`, host prep via `tar --strip-components=1` from the GitHub source tarball, per-instance directories under `/var/photo-diary/<name>/` with their own `.env`, `code` symlink, photos, and SQLite DB, nginx vhost per instance, atomic upgrade via the `init-instance` script.

### Server

- Replace the `uuid` dep with the built-in `crypto.randomUUID()`
- Send `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, noai, noimageai` on every response, including served photo files
- Add a DB migration runner that uses `meta.schema_version` as the cursor; runs at server startup against the better-sqlite3 driver. Bootstraps fresh DBs from `db/sqlite3/migrations/001_baseline.sql`, then advances to v2 via `002_fix_gallery_photo_fk.sql` which rebuilds `gallery_photo` with the correct singular FK references (the long-standing `photos`/`galleries` typo). Drops the obsolete `schema/sqlite3.ddl`, `schema/migrate/sqlite3_from_0.ddl`, and `migrate_legacy_to_sqlite3.sh`.
- Resolve the bundled-frontend static directory from `import.meta.dirname` (with `STATIC_DIR` override) so the server can be started from any working directory — needed for the multi-instance deploy where the code lives at a shared path and each instance has its own CWD.

### Frontend

- Replace `mathjs` with inline native `mean`/`stddev` helpers in `stats.tsx`; production bundle drops ~40% (1.5 MB → 876 kB raw, 460 kB → 282 kB gzipped)
- Drop `react-helmet-async` in favor of React 19's native `<title>`/`<meta>` hoisting (6 call sites)
- Enumerate AI-training bots explicitly in `robots.txt` (GPTBot, Google-Extended, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot, CCBot, etc.) for crawlers that ignore the `User-agent: *` wildcard
- Drop the six `VITE_*` build-time env vars; defaults live in `lib/config.ts` and `Gallery/index.tsx` applies runtime overrides from `/api/v1/meta` (`defaultGallery`, `defaultTheme`, `initialGalleryView`, `firstWeekday`) on top of the existing `cdn` → `PHOTO_ROOT_URL` path, so one frontend build serves any instance
  - **Breaking (deployment):** per-instance overrides move from `react-app/.env` to the **server's** `.env`. Rename `VITE_DEFAULT_GALLERY` → `DEFAULT_GALLERY`, `VITE_THEME` → `DEFAULT_THEME`, `VITE_INITIAL_GALLERY_VIEW` → `INITIAL_GALLERY_VIEW`, `VITE_FIRST_WEEKDAY` → `FIRST_WEEKDAY` in each deployed instance's `server/.env`. `VITE_PHOTO_ROOT_URL` should already be using the `instance_cdn` meta row. `VITE_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE` doesn't map — change the literal in `lib/config.ts` if you need a different fallback; i18next initializes before meta loads.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-19

### Features

- Add map to statistics page
- Cluster closely grouped markers on the map

### Server

- Replace jsonwebtoken with jose to unblock Node 26
- Upgrade test infrastructure (jest 29, supertest 7, nodemon 3)
- Upgrade runtime dependencies (bcrypt 6, dotenv 17, uuid 11, cross-env 10, etc.)
- Upgrade to Express 5
- Upgrade ESLint to v9 with flat config
- Migrate to ESM (vitest replaces jest, drops cross-env and nodemon)
- Swap sqlite3 for better-sqlite3 (sync API, simpler driver code)
  - **Heads-up (long-lived DBs):** better-sqlite3 enables `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` by default, whereas the old `sqlite3` driver left it off. If your prod DB was bootstrapped from the legacy schema, the `gallery_photo` foreign keys point at `photos(id)` / `galleries(id)` (plural) instead of the actual `photo` / `gallery` tables, and every mutation now fails with `no such table: main.galleries`. Fix by rebuilding the table on the prod DB with corrected references (back up first): `CREATE TABLE gallery_photo_new (gallery_id TEXT, photo_id TEXT, PRIMARY KEY(photo_id, gallery_id), FOREIGN KEY(photo_id) REFERENCES photo(id), FOREIGN KEY(gallery_id) REFERENCES gallery(id)); INSERT INTO gallery_photo_new SELECT * FROM gallery_photo; DROP TABLE gallery_photo; ALTER TABLE gallery_photo_new RENAME TO gallery_photo;` — wrap in `PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF; BEGIN; … COMMIT; PRAGMA foreign_key_check; PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON;`.
- Migrate to TypeScript (strict mode, tsx runtime)
- Type SQLite row shapes per table in the db layer; drop the `Record<string, any>` escape hatches
- Tighten `tsconfig.json`: drop `allowJs`/`checkJs` now that no `.js` source remains
- Quieten dotenv 17 "tip" output in tests via `DOTENV_CONFIG_QUIET=true`; keep production on side-effect `import "dotenv/config"` so `.env` loads during import resolution
- Make `bin/add-user.ts`, `bin/add-gallery.ts`, `bin/add-photo.ts` directly runnable via a `#!/usr/bin/env -S npx tsx` shebang (no more `npx tsx bin/…` prefix needed from `server/`)

### Converter

- Upgrade dependencies (jest 29, nodemon 3, dotenv 17, etc.)
- Upgrade ESLint to v9 with flat config
- Migrate to ESM + TypeScript (chokidar 4, image-size 2)
- Replace `gm` with `sharp`; image processing is ~20× faster on real-size photos
  - **Breaking (deployment):** the converter no longer requires the ImageMagick (or GraphicsMagick) CLI on the host — sharp ships its own libvips bindings via npm. You can `apt-get remove imagemagick` (or equivalent) on the converter host. CI's converter job no longer installs imagemagick.

### Frontend (react-app)

- Replace CRA with Vite + Vitest; swap react-helmet for react-helmet-async, axios for native fetch, drop date-diff
  - **Breaking (deployment):** frontend env vars in `react-app/.env` (and any per-environment `.env`) renamed from `REACT_APP_*` to `VITE_*`. Update each deployed environment's config: `REACT_APP_PHOTO_ROOT_URL` → `VITE_PHOTO_ROOT_URL`, `REACT_APP_THEME` → `VITE_THEME`, `REACT_APP_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE` → `VITE_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE`, `REACT_APP_DEFAULT_GALLERY` → `VITE_DEFAULT_GALLERY`, `REACT_APP_INITIAL_GALLERY_VIEW` → `VITE_INITIAL_GALLERY_VIEW`, `REACT_APP_FIRST_WEEKDAY` → `VITE_FIRST_WEEKDAY`. Old names are silently ignored at build time.
- Warm-up dep refresh: jose 4→6, mathjs 10→15, react-icons 4→5, geo-coord 0.1→0.2, jsdom 25→27, globals 16→17, vitest 2→3. Drop unused `@testing-library/user-event`.
- Upgrade to React 18 with coupled deps: react/react-dom/react-is 17→18, react-helmet-async 1→2, react-leaflet 3→4, react-leaflet-markercluster 3→4, react-chartjs-2 3→4, react-i18next 11→14 with i18next 21→23, react-swipeable 6→7, @testing-library/react 12→14
- Upgrade `react-router-dom` 5→7 (skips intermediate v6): `Switch` → `Routes`, `element` prop replaces children, `Redirect` → `Navigate` with explicit `replace`
- Upgrade to React 19 with coupled deps: react/react-dom/react-is 18→19, react-helmet-async 2→3, react-leaflet 4→5, react-leaflet-markercluster 4→5.0.0-rc.0, react-chartjs-2 4→5 with chart.js 3→4, react-i18next 14→17 with i18next 23→26, @testing-library/react 14→16
- Swap `styled-components` for `@emotion/styled` (37 files); the one `createGlobalStyle` site converts to emotion's `Global` component
- Migrate to strict TypeScript across source and tests (8-PR incremental migration covering setup, lib, models, services, stats, components, and tests); drop `prop-types` runtime dep and `allowJs`
- Export `StatsTopic` / `StatsCategory` / `KpiItem` / `ChartSpec` / `TableColumn` / `TableRow` / `UniqueValues` types from `lib/stats`; replaces ~25 `any` annotations threading through Gallery, Filters, and Stats components
- Upgrade Vite 6→8 and `@vitejs/plugin-react` 4→5; production build ~4× faster via Rolldown

### Cross-package

- Add GitHub Actions CI for server, converter, and react-app
- Refresh server and converter dependencies to latest majors: vitest 4, uuid 14, jose 6, yargs 18, TypeScript 6, ESLint 10, chokidar 5, `@types/*` packages
- Patch-bump server and converter dev deps: `@types/node` 25.8→25.9, `tsx` 4.22.1→4.22.2, `typescript-eslint` 8.59.3→8.59.4
