# Photo Diary

**Photo Diary** is a calendar-based photo gallery platform for self-hosting. The photos are arranged by the date they were shot, in calendar-based views, aimed at diaries and other, date-based photography projects.

Key features include:

- Calendar-based views (year, month, day, photo)
  - Including map from embedded GPS information
- Comprehensive photo statistics (time, gear, exposure settings, etc.)
- Fast browsing – gallery content (apart from actual photos) loaded once at startup
- User management and basic access control

## Structure

Photo Diary is split into separate independent modules, each handling its own sub-system:

- [react-app](react-app) – Front-end web app
- [server](server) – Back-end API
- [converter](converter) – Back-end process for pre-processing new photos to be added to the gallery

### Basic Setup

- Create a reposity directory structure, separate from the code
  - Must include the sub-directories `inbox`, `original`, `display`, and `thumbnail`
  - Configure `PHOTO_ROOT_DIR` on [converter](converter) and [react-app](react-app) to point to this directory
- Setup [server](server) and [converter](converter) to run as a background process, e.g. using [pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/)
- Build [react-app](react-app) into [server](server), running in the [server](server) directory:
  - `npm run build:ui`
